<p>Well here we are. After three years of going through this venture, I figured it&rsquo;s a good time to reflect on what has happened through these 5 semesters.</p>
<p>So, the story goes as follows. I wrote the first paragraph and had to leave for an errand for a while. Then I came back and realized the score for one of my courses was in &ndash; one that I was partially hopeful not to be awful. Boy oh boy how wrong was I! My attitude before this revelation was more on the positive side that I managed to lead a fairly decent student life. Now, not so much.</p>
<p>I always believed that the main benefit of college is getting to know like-minded classmates and smart people who sacrificed a considerable amount to qualify to attend the top universities (top is an exaggerated adjective to use for College of Computer Engineering in University of Tehran, but it&rsquo;s what we got in Iran anyway, I&rsquo;ve heard it once was a fine establishment). So I started university with the mindset that pursuing high scores was a second priority. Now I think of it as a cope to not try to reach excellence and avoid losing in another race or contest after a loss from my Olympiad era &ndash; I don&rsquo;t regret anything from then but it was a loss anyway. I usually settled for good enough other than courses that I was personally passionate about. Even having near failures in subjects I didn&rsquo;t deem worthy of my time (still I don&rsquo;t think there is any alternate universe in which I can ace signal processing with Fourier transforms feeding into Laplace and whatnot but not writing it off from the beginning of the semester wouldn&rsquo;t be the worst thing).</p>
<p>Then comes the first priority, how did I do with the connection building?</p>
<p>I was once called a &ldquo;Lonely Loser&rdquo; from my boss</p>
